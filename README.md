# ðŸ§± 3D Object Sorting

This Python project demonstrates how to sort 3D objects based on their distance from the camera using the [Ursina Game Engine](https://www.ursinaengine.org/). It visually shows how render order affects transparency and occlusion, essential for real-time rendering.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project in a Python virtual environment.


### 1. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

### 2. Activate the virtual environment

On Windows:

```
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS/Linux:

```
source myenv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install package dependencies inside virtual environment

```
pip install ursina
```
### Files

1. game.py â€” Main script with camera, wall, and soldier entities.

2. soldier.glb â€” 3D model of soldier (replace with your own .glb if needed).
